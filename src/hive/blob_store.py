"""
Blob store for Hive — S3-backed storage for memories that exceed the
DynamoDB 400 KB item limit (or are non-text by construction).

DynamoDB is the authoritative index — every memory has a META item.
When the inline value would overflow DynamoDB, or the caller passes a
non-text ``value_type``, the content is stored in S3 under
``s3://{bucket}/{owner}/{memory_id}`` and a pointer is kept in the
META item as ``s3_uri``.

The 100 KB inline/S3 threshold sits well under DynamoDB's 400 KB
per-item cap so the headers, tag list, timestamps etc. never tip the
item over.

All operations are best-effort at the protocol level — they raise on
hard failures so the caller can surface a meaningful error rather
than silently losing data.
