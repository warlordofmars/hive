const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is my data private? Who can see my memories?",
    a: "Your memories are scoped to your account. Only you can read, write, or delete them. Admins of the Hive service can access data for operational purposes (e.g. debugging, compliance), but no data is shared with third parties or used for training.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the usage limits?",
    a: `Free accounts can store up to ${FREE_TIER_MEMORY_LIMIT} memories. Once you reach the limit, new memories are rejected until you delete existing ones. Additional rate limits may apply to prevent abuse. We'll communicate any changes to these limits with plenty of notice.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Which MCP clients are supported?",
    a: "Any client that implements the Model Context Protocol works with Hive. Tested clients include Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Continue. If your client supports MCP, it will work.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I delete my account or data?",
    a: "You can delete individual memories at any time from the Memory Browser in the management UI. To delete your account and all associated data, sign in and use the account settings, or contact us and we will remove everything within 30 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the service goes down?",
    a: "Hive is hosted on AWS with Lambda and DynamoDB, both of which have high availability SLAs. If the service is unavailable, your MCP client will receive an error and can degrade gracefully. Memories are not lost during downtime.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this free forever?",
    a: "The current free tier will remain free. If paid plans are introduced in the future, existing free-tier accounts will keep their current access. We will communicate any changes well in advance.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I connect my MCP client?",
    a: "Sign in, register a client in the management UI, and copy the one-line config snippet into your MCP client's configuration file. Full step-by-step instructions are in the docs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Hive work offline or self-hosted?",
    a: "The hosted service requires an internet connection. Self-hosting is not officially supported at this time, though the project is open source and you are welcome to deploy your own instance.",
  },
