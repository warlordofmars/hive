## [Unreleased]

_Changes accumulated on `development` since v0.24.0. Will be rolled into the next release._

## v0.24.0 — 2026-04-20

### Added

#### Stats tab — six new analytics views

- New **Stats** tab in the management UI, fed by a single `/api/account/stats` endpoint (#572). Each view rolls up the caller's memories without touching cross-tenant data, and gracefully degrades when the workspace is empty. Six views landed across the milestone:
  - Top-recalled memories, tag distribution, memory-growth trend, and a quota gauge — the at-a-glance dashboard surfaces the most-used and least-used corners of the workspace (#581).
  - 12-month activity heatmap (calendar grid keyed off `recall_count` / `created_at`) so usage patterns and dormant periods are visible at a glance (#579).
  - Memory freshness scatter — plots `last_accessed_at` vs `created_at` so stale items are visually obvious (#600, post-merge cleanup in #603).
  - Client contribution breakdown — per-client write counts, recall counts, and quota share (#604).
  - Tag co-occurrence network — graph view of which tags appear together, useful for spotting taxonomy drift (#605).

#### MCP surface

- New `pack_context(topic, budget_tokens=2000, ordering="relevance+recency")` tool — token-budget-aware retrieval that returns as many relevant memories as fit in the caller's remaining context window, formatted as a markdown block. Same hybrid retrieval backbone as `search_memories`; greedy packer skips (rather than truncates) over-budget memories so a half-quoted decision can't slip through; redacted memories always excluded. Uses a 4-chars-per-token heuristic instead of `tiktoken` to keep the Lambda bundle slim. (#608, docs polish in #613)
- Memories are now exposed as **MCP Resources** alongside tools, URI-addressable via `memory://_index` (the static index) and `memory://{key}` (templated). Resource handlers enforce `memories:read` scope and the same rate-limit / tenant-isolation as tools; redacted and expired items are filtered. The reserved `_index` namespace avoids collision with a memory whose key happens to be `index`. (#609)
- New **MCP Prompts** — slash commands for common Hive workflows (`recall`, `summarize`, etc.), discoverable via `prompts/list` in supporting clients. (#606)

#### Observability & ops

- `RateLimitedRequests` CloudWatch metric (EMF) emitted on every 429 from the rate-limiter + a Dashboard card showing the rolling count, so quota exhaustion shows up before a customer reports it. (#571)

#### Dev experience & CI

- Autonomous Copilot review loop integrated into the §7.5 PR workflow — every agent-safe PR gets a Copilot review, with auto-merge deferred until the loop resolves; up to 5 fix-iterations before stopping for human review. Multiple iterations of process-tightening landed across the milestone after observed gaps: re-arm auto-merge after each Copilot-driven fix push, fix the `get_reviews` blind spot in the polling loop, require a reply on every thread before resolving, wait ~90s after the Agent check completes before polling for line-level comments, bump the iteration cap from 3 to 5. (#580, #582, #601, #603, #607, #612)

### Fixed

#### Security

- **OAuth auth-code redemption is now atomic** — closes RFC 6749 §10.5 TOCTOU. Two concurrent `POST /oauth/token` requests with the same code used to both pass the `auth_code.used` pre-check before either could write back, both successfully exchanging for token pairs. `mark_auth_code_used` now uses a conditional `UpdateItem` guarded by `attribute_exists(PK) AND used = false`; the loser of the race gets a `ConditionalCheckFailedException`, translated to a new `AuthCodeAlreadyUsed` exception that the token endpoint maps to the same `400 "Invalid or already-used code"` response as the pre-check. The `attribute_exists(PK)` guard also closes a forged-code path: callers can no longer mint tokens by passing arbitrary strings. (#611)

#### Reliability

- Audit-log endpoint missed events that landed near midnight UTC — the date-range query was off-by-one in the hour-sharded `AUDIT#{date}#{hour}` partition lookup. Now the boundary hours are queried correctly so compliance trails stay complete. (#599)

### Meta

- CLAUDE.md §7.5 hardened across the milestone: every Copilot review thread now gets a reply before resolution; the loop polls for line-level comments after the Agent check completes (with a ~90s buffer) instead of relying on top-level reviews; iteration cap raised from 3 to 5; auto-merge re-armed after each Copilot-driven fix push so a downstream finding doesn't leave the PR un-merged. (#582, #607, #612)

## v0.23.0 — 2026-04-19

### Added

#### Documentation

- Auto-generated REST API reference at `/docs/api-reference`, rendered from the deployed FastAPI app's OpenAPI spec. Starts in light mode, follows the docs-site appearance toggle into dark mode, and is kept in sync with a CI drift check against a committed `openapi.json` snapshot. After landing on Scalar and then Redoc (neither of which survived light-mode scrutiny on our navy chrome), settled on Swagger UI with a community dark stylesheet overlay. (#421, #551, #552, #554, #558)

#### Admin dashboard

- Alarm row now scales with signal instead of drowning the view in green pills. During normal operation a single `✓ N alarms OK` summary badge replaces the per-alarm row; as soon as anything is firing, the `ALARM` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` badges appear individually with a muted `+N OK` pill trailing them. (#369, #553)

### Changed

#### Cross-surface mobile UX

- Swept the marketing site, docs site, and management app for mobile parity. Unified navbar across all three: always-visible Sign in/out, always-visible theme toggle, hamburger drawer identical in layout. Drawer items left-aligned with an orange left-border active indicator (replacing the gray-fill highlight). Dashboard, Activity Log, and Logs viewer no longer overflow horizontally on narrow viewports — header / stat-card / filter rows now wrap, and individual log rows restack into three lines on mobile (header / log-group / 2-line-clamped summary with tap-to-expand). (#533, #541, #543, #544, #545, #547, #549, #550, #562, #563, #564, #566)

### Fixed

#### CI reliability

- Raised the httpx timeout on all e2e HTTP clients from the default 5s to 30s, absorbing Lambda cold-start on the first DCR call in a test run. (#565)
- Doubled the tag-filter GSI-propagation retry window in `test_create_and_see_memory` from 60s to 120s while #568 investigates the underlying propagation lag. The raised budget keeps the dev pipeline green; the lag itself is treated as a product bug, not a test flake. (#546)

### Meta

- Removed the `release-milestone-watcher` workflow — the CLAUDE.md autonomous loop already detects milestone drain in-session, making the separate workflow redundant. (#531, #532)

## v0.22.0 — 2026-04-18

### Added

#### MCP surface

- Every MCP tool response carries the caller's quota and rate-limit state under a top-level `_meta.hive` block (`memory_quota.{used,limit,remaining}` + `rate_limit.{per_minute_limit,per_day_limit}`) so well-behaved agents can self-throttle before hitting a hard limit. New docs page `/docs/concepts/quotas` documents the schema. `memory_history` now returns `{versions, count}` instead of a bare list for a consistent structured-content envelope. (#453)
- Long-running tools (`search_memories`, `summarize_context`) emit MCP `notifications/progress` events at major stages; supporting clients render progress indicators. Best-effort — falls through on clients that don't support it. (#449)
- `remember(key, value, …, version=)` accepts an optimistic-lock token from a prior `recall`/`list_memories` response; concurrent-write conflicts raise a `ToolError` with the current state JSON-encoded so agents can compare-and-retry. (#391)
- `search_memories` now hybrid-retrieves: weighted blend of semantic similarity, term-frequency keyword match, and half-life recency decay against `last_accessed_at`/`updated_at`. Three optional `w_semantic/w_keyword/w_recency` params re-normalise to 1.0. Per-signal sub-scores exposed for debugging + agent-side re-ranking. (#481)
- `summarize_context` synthesises memories via MCP Sampling — the client's own model produces the briefing, with a deterministic concat fallback for clients that don't support sampling. (#448)
- New `redact_memory(key, reason=None)` tool tombstones a value while preserving the record: sets `Memory.redacted_at`, replaces value with `__redacted__`, writes the pre-redaction value to the audit log. `recall` on a redacted memory returns a sentinel; `list_memories` + `search_memories` skip redacted items by default (opt-in via `include_redacted`). (#400)
- `Memory.recall_count` + `last_accessed_at` — bumped atomically on every successful `recall`; surfaced on list/search results for ranking, dashboards, and memory-decay scoring. (#394)

#### Compliance & observability

- `log_audit_event` is now called from every memory-touching tool, producing an immutable `AUDIT#` trail separate from the user-visible activity log. Audit items carry a DynamoDB TTL (`HIVE_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 365) and a new `GET /api/admin/audit-log` endpoint exposes them with `client_id` / `event_type` / date-range filters. (#395)
- `POST /api/csp-report` receives browser CSP violation reports (both legacy `application/csp-report` and modern `application/reports+json`), logs them structured to CloudWatch, and emits a `CSPViolations` EMF metric (aggregate + per-directive drill-down). Unauthenticated by design; per-IP rate-limited. Admin dashboard gets a "Security" section showing the count. (#488)

#### Dev experience & CI

- Release Drafter keeps a draft GitHub release current as PRs merge into `development`, grouped by category label — no more hand-maintained `[Unreleased]`. Label-check workflow now requires a category label on every linked issue. (#420)
- `release-milestone-watcher` workflow opens a "Release: cut vX.Y" tracking issue when any `vX.Y` milestone drains to zero open non-epic issues. Pairs with the in-session stop condition. (#484, #512)

### Meta

- CLAUDE.md: design-review workflow + product-decision section. (#506)
- CLAUDE.md: milestone preference added to the issue selection algorithm. (#514)

## v0.21.0 — 2026-04-18

## v0.21.0 — 2026-04-18

### Added

#### MCP surface

- New `ping` tool for connectivity and auth health checks (#411)
- New `list_tags` tool for tag-space discovery (#415)
- New `relate_memories(key, top_k)` tool — semantic traversal from a memory to its nearest neighbours (#465)
- New `remember_if_absent(key, value, tags?, ttl_seconds?)` — conditional write only when the key doesn't already exist (#466)
- `search_memories` gained `min_score` (score threshold) and `filter_tags` (tag-intersection filter) parameters (#412, #444)
- `remember` enforces a UTF-8 byte-size cap on `value` (default 10 KB, configurable via `HIVE_MAX_VALUE_BYTES`) (#403)
- Every tool now advertises title + `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint` so capable clients can auto-approve read-only calls and confirm destructive ones (#469)
- `list_memories` and `search_memories` responses now include `owner_client_id`; the memory browser renders a "by {client name}" attribution badge on every card (#463)

#### Compliance & privacy

- GDPR Article 20 / CCPA §1798.100 data export: `GET /api/account/export` streams a JSON bundle with the user's profile, memories, OAuth clients, and the last 90 days of activity; rate-limited to one export per 5 min (#468)
- Opt-in GA4 cookie consent banner — no tracking script loads until the visitor clicks Accept; choice persisted in `localStorage`, revocable via a footer "Cookie preferences" link (#467)
- New `/subprocessors` page listing AWS, Google OAuth, and Google Analytics with purpose, data categories, and location; cross-linked from Privacy §4 and the FAQ (#470)

#### Infrastructure, security, & observability

- CloudFront response-headers policy: HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and a `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` draft; enforcing CSP tracked separately (#473)
- New CloudWatch alarms: Lambda throttles (MCP + API), DynamoDB user errors, and Bearer-token auth failures; every prod alarm now pages both on firing and on recovery (OK actions); first-deploy runbook documents the SNS subscription flow (#474)
- Backup / restore runbook for prod DynamoDB PITR recovery — when-to, pre-flight, restore, swap, validation, cleanup, post-mortem template, and annual drill guidance (#478)
- SEO: `robots.txt` + `sitemap.xml` for marketing SPA + VitePress-generated docs sitemap (#443)
- Open Graph + Twitter Card metadata across marketing and docs pages so shared links render proper preview cards (#455)

#### Dev experience & CI

- Key-naming conventions docs page with the recommended `{domain}:{entity-type}/{entity-id}:{attribute}` pattern and examples (#408)
- `main`-branch guard: PRs to `main` from anything other than `development` or `release/*` fail a required status check, preventing another v0.20.0-style release-bypass (#477)
- Dependabot now runs daily for pip and npm (github-actions stays weekly) and passing Dependabot PRs auto-merge (#432, #445)
- ChatGPT joins the supported-clients list everywhere; Claude Desktop setup now leads with the Custom Connector URL flow (mcp-remote JSON kept as a legacy fallback) (#485)

### Fixed

- Pricing page claimed "unlimited memories" while the free-tier quota is 500 (#404)
- Privacy Policy / Terms referenced `privacy@hive.so` and `hello@hive.so` on a domain we don't own; switched to `@warlordofmars.net` (#431)
- Marketing home page's "3-step setup" described a flow that doesn't exist ("register a client", "one-line snippet"); rewritten to match `SetupPanel` and the docs, including the browser-OAuth step (#471)

### Meta

- CLAUDE.md: deterministic selection algorithm for the autonomous issue queue (#461)
- CLAUDE.md: label taxonomy (status / priority / size / area) and milestone policy; enforced at PR merge via `label-check.yml` (#462, #464)
- CLAUDE.md: autonomous agent halts and surfaces `HUMAN_INPUT_REQUIRED` when the active release milestone drains (#483)
- CHANGELOG: retroactive v0.20.0 entry documenting what actually shipped there (#476)

## v0.20.0 — 2026-04-17

> **Note**: v0.20.0 was cut from a single PR that bypassed the normal release-branch workflow. The intended scope of this milestone (compliance work, accuracy audit, MCP annotations, etc.) was merged to `development` after the tag was already pushed and will ship in v0.21.0. This entry documents what actually shipped in v0.20.0. See #475 for the branch-protection follow-up to prevent this recurring.
